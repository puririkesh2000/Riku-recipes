    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Instant noodles, or instant ramen, are noodles sold in a precooked and dried block with flavoring powder and/or
        seasoning oil. The flavoring is usually in a separate packet, although in the case of cup noodles, the flavoring
        is often loose in the cup.</p>
    <p>The main ingredients used in dried noodles are usually wheat flour, palm oil, and salt. Common ingredients in the
        flavoring powder are salt, monosodium glutamate, seasoning, and sugar. The dried noodle block was originally
        created by flash frying cooked noodles, and this is still the main method used in Asian countries, but air-dried
        noodle blocks are favored in Western countries.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Instant noodles</li>
        <li>soy sause</li>
        <li>garlic oil</li>
        <li>sliced spring onions</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Boil the watter , all seasoning packets</li>
        <li>Drop the noodles-Gently</li>
        <li>Fan it(see below)
            <ul>
                <li><strong>This is critical</strong>: I find that simply boiling the noodles for 4-5 minutes, as most ramen directions read, produces
                        a limp and soggy noodle. To avoid this, you have to slow down the noodleâ€™s cooking process while
                        the broth continues to cook. The best way to do this: fan the noodles.flow of air will stunt the
                        cooking process, which gives the noodles a slightly more al dente texture.
