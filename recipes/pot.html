    <h1>Instant pot -Chicken and Dumpling</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        I wanted the richness of long-simmered chicken stew, but without the fuss of using a whole chicken. This
        compromise, using boneless skinless chicken thighs with bone-in chicken breast, gave me the richness of flavor
        and ease of preparation I was looking for! It's basically chicken pot pie made in a pressure cooker rather than
        an oven.

        <li>½ cup diced carrot</li>
        <li>½ cup diced celery </li>
        <li> 1 bay leaf</li>
        <li> 4 cups low-sodium chicken broth</li>
        <li> 1 pound boneless, skinless chicken thighs</li>
        <li> 1 pound bone-in chicken breasts, skin removed</li>
        <li> ½ teaspoon thyme (Optional)</li>
        <li> ½ teaspoon dried marjoram</li>
        <li> 1 teaspoon salt (Optional)</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper </li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened </li>
        <li> 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li> salt and ground black pepper to taste (Optional) </li>
        <li> ½ cup frozen petite peas</li>
        <li>½ cup frozen cut green beans</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Dumplings:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li> ½ teaspoon salt (Optional)</li>
        <li> 2 tablespoons cold unsalted butter</li>
        <li> 1 tablespoon chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley</li>
        <li> ½ cup buttermilk</li>

    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Step 1</li>
        <p> Pour the olive oil into a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as an Instant Pot®) and select the Saute
            function. Cook onion, carrot, celery, and bay leaf until the vegetables are soft and the onion has turned
            translucent, about 5 minutes. </p>
        <li>Step 2</li>
        <p> Add chicken broth, chicken thighs, chicken breasts, thyme, marjoram, salt, and pepper. Close and lock the
            lid. Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 9 minutes. Allow 10 to 15
            minutes for pressure to build. </p>
        <li>Step 3</li>
        <p> Release pressure carefully using the quick-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about 5
            minutes. Carefully remove the chicken pieces with tongs and place them in a bowl to cool slightly; discard
            bay leaf. </p>
        <li>Step 4</li>
        <p> Mash butter with the flour to make a smooth paste; set aside. </p>
        <li>Step 5</li>
        <p> Combine flour, baking powder, and salt in a bowl for the dumplings. Cut in cold butter until mixture is the
            texture of cornmeal. Stir in parsley and set aside. </p>
        <li>Step 6</li>
        <p>Shred cooled chicken and return to the pot. Taste the broth and adjust the seasoning if needed. Add peas and
            green beans. Stir in the flour-butter paste. Select Saute function to bring broth back to a boil. </p>
        <li>Step 7</li>
        <p> Pour buttermilk into the dumpling mixture and stir until combined. Drop the dumpling dough by heaping
            spoonfuls on top of the stew; a small cookie scoop works well. </p>
        <li>Step 8</li>
        <p> Cover pot with the lid, leaving the steam vent open. Select Slow Cooker function and simmer on Low, covered,
            until dumplings are cooked through, 10 to 12 minutes. A skewer inserted in the center of a dumpling should
            come out clean. </p>
